        <p> 
            EvE Online is a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) that sets itself apart from the rest by being entirely player driven.
            Save a few activities, everything in the game is done by other players, from mining materials to items sold on market. Even the ships, weapons, and ammunition
            are made and traded by players. There are many different 
            activities a player can take part in, in this massive sandbox environment, but the bottom line is, anything goes in EvE from merchant scamming to pirates, from megacorporations to 
            small manufacturing ventures, Isk(in game money) is the name of the game.

          EvE online is such a large player driven game that its easy to get overwhelmed with the scope of activities and content available.
          A good resource for learning how and what to do in game is the <a id='tribute-link' href='https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page' target="_blank">EvE University</a>
          website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A good place to start is to complete the into tutorials and the beginner missions. These give you an adequate introduction tothe game and its mechanics.
          After you get a try at all the different content options its best to decide which activity you want to pursue the most. Once you decide that its best to start a search
          for a decent starter Corporation. Personally, I suggest EvE University, they have many different departments, campuses and players that do a little bit of everything!
          having others to ask for help or advice can go a long way in the game. They also have actual classes that cover many core concepts and gameplay. There are even weekly Q&A sessions
          with experienced players. The <a id='class-link' href='https://www.eveuniversity.org/events/' target='_blank'>Events</a> page is a good place to see what classes are available
          for the month. All classes are open to the public, all you need is <a id='mumble-link' href='https://www.mumble.info/' target='_blank'>Mumble</a> for voice chat and a learning attitude!
          The learning curve can be steep but the game is extremely rewarding and fun once you make a few friends and get the hang of things!
