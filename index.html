        <p> 
            EvE Online is a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) that sets itself apart from the rest by being entirely player driven.
            Save a few activities, everything in the game is done by other players, from mining materials to items sold on market. Even the ships, weapons, and ammunition
            are made and traded by players. There are many different 
            activities a player can take part in, in this massive sandbox environment, but the bottom line is, anything goes in EvE from merchant scamming to pirates, from megacorporations to 
            small manufacturing ventures, Isk(in game money) is the name of the game.
